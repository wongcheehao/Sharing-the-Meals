# the-perfect-matchup
You and your friends are playing this new mobile video game called Diabro Immoral Gacha
(DIG). The game revolves around building a team of M characters to compete with other teams
in a tournament. You aimed to be the very best, like no one ever was in the game.

Thus, you have done your research into past tournaments in preparation for the biggest tournament. 
You aim to nd the best performing team composition against the other teams. You are however dealing 
with a large amount of tournament results. Unlike other competitors, you
are able to process this data eciently using sorting algorithms (counting and radix)
you have learnt from FIT2004.

For this task, you are to write a Python function called analyze(results, roster, score)
which will perform an analysis on the tournament results. The input, output and complexity
for this function is to be discussed in their individual sections Section 1.1, Section 1.2 and

Section 1.3 respectively.
1.1 Input
The past tournament data results is presented as a list of lists 1

. The inner list can be

described as [team1, team2, score] where:
 team1 and team2 are uppercase strings.
 Both team1 and team2 are of the same length, denoted by the positive integer M.
 Both team1 and team2 are from the same character set, denoted by the positive
integer roster. For example, roster=5 indicates a character set of {A, B, C, D,
E}. It is possible that not all characters from the roster set would necessarily appear
in the team composition 2
.

 Teams can have multiple instances of the same character, for example, team ABA
with two As.
 The order of characters in team1 and team2 do not matter. A team of ABC is regarded
to be the same as a team of some permutation of ABC, such as BAC or BCA.
 score is an integer value in the range of 0 to 100 inclusive.
 It denotes the score obtained by team1 in a match against team2.
 It also denotes the score of (100âˆ’score) obtained by team team2 in the same match
against team1.

1
Instead of a list of tuples, so that they are mutable.
2Often occurs when a character is undertuned or out of the meta.

A snapshot of the data is provided below, containing N = 20 matches between teams of M = 3
characters. In general:
 N is a large number.
 The matches are not listed in any specic order in results.
 It is possible to have multiple matches between the same teams, with dierent score. For
example, it is possible for results to contain matches ['ECA', 'CDE', 13], ['CEA',
'CDE', 20], ['CEA', 'CDE', 88] and ['CDE', 'ECA', 68] which involves the same
team composition against each other but with dierent arrangements and scores.
>>> results
[['EAE', 'BCA', 85], ['EEE', 'BDB', 17], ['EAD', 'ECD', 21],
['ECA', 'CDE', 13], ['CDA', 'ABA', 76], ['BEA', 'CEC', 79],
['EAE', 'CED', 8], ['CBE', 'CEA', 68], ['CDA', 'CEA', 58],
['ACE', 'DEE', 24], ['DDC', 'DCA', 61], ['CDE', 'BDE', 67],
['DED', 'EDD', 83], ['ABC', 'CAB', 54], ['AAB', 'BDB', 15],
['BBE', 'EAD', 28], ['ACD', 'DCD', 50], ['DEB', 'CAA', 21],
['EBE', 'AAC', 24], ['EBD', 'BCD', 48]]
 The rst match of result in the example is ['EAE', 'BCA', 85], which means that:
 A team of 1 A character and 2 E characters (AEE)
has a score of 85 against
a team of 1 A character, 1 B character and 1 C character (ABC).
 A team of 1 A character, 1 B character and 1 C character (ABC)
has a score of 15 against
a team of 1 A character and 2 E characters (AEE).
 The last match of result in the example is ['EBD', 'BCD', 48], which means that:
 A team of 1 B character, 1 D character and 1 E character (BDE)
has a score of 48 against
a team of 1 B character, 1 C character and 1 D character (BCD).
 A team of 1 B character, 1 C character and 1 D character (BCD)
has a score of 52 against
a team of 1 B character, 1 D character and 1 E character (BDE).

1.2 Output
The function analyze(results, roster, score) returns a list of ndings denoted as
[top10matches, searchedmatches] where:
 top10matches is a list of 10 matches with the highest score.
 The returned matches are sorted rstly in descending order by their scores, followed
by ascending lexicographical order for team1 (where scores are equal), and nally by
ascending lexicographical order for team2 (where scores and team1 are equal).
 If there are matches between the same teams with the same score, only one of those
matches would be included in the list. The list could however include matches
between the same teams but with dierent scores.
 If there are less than 10 matches; then the list would contain the maximum number
of matches possible.
 You can assume that there will always be at least one match to be returned in
top10matches.
 searchedmatches is a list of matches with the same score as score.
 score is an integer within the range of 0 to 100 inclusive.
 The returned matches are sorted rstly in ascending lexicographical order for team1,
and secondly in ascending lexicographical order for team2 (where team1 is the same).
 If there are matches between the same teams, only one of the matches would be
included.
 If the score is not found, then return the matches with the closest score which is
higher. If there are no matches with a higher score, then return an empty list.

Consider the example input below:
# a roster of 2 characters
roster = 2
# results with 20 matches
results =
[['AAB', 'AAB', 35], ['AAB', 'BBA', 49], ['BAB', 'BAB', 42],
['AAA', 'AAA', 38], ['BAB', 'BAB', 36], ['BAB', 'BAB', 36],
['ABA', 'BBA', 57], ['BBB', 'BBA', 32], ['BBA', 'BBB', 49],
['BBA', 'ABB', 55], ['AAB', 'AAA', 58], ['ABA', 'AAA', 46],
['ABA', 'ABB', 44], ['BBB', 'BAB', 32], ['AAA', 'AAB', 36],
['ABA', 'BBB', 48], ['BBB', 'ABA', 33], ['AAB', 'BBA', 30],
['ABB', 'BBB', 68], ['BAB', 'BBB', 52]]

Which returns the following output:
"""

# looking for a score of 64

top10matches as a list of 10 matches. The following observations can be made:
 The characters in the team compositions are sorted in lexicographical order.
 The highest score of 70 comes from the match ['AAB', 'BBA', 30]. As discussed in
earlier Section 1.1, this match would also have an equivalent of ['BBA', 'AAB', 70].
 For the score of 68, there are in fact 2 entries. The rst entry is ['ABB', 'BBB', 68]
and the second entry being ['BBB', 'BBA', 32] which is equivalent to ['BBA', 'BBB',
68]. These 2 entries are however not unique, and thus only 1 would be presented in the
output.
 The matches are sorted according to their score.
 For matches with the same score, they are sorted according to the lexicographical order
of the teams.
searchedmatches is observed to be ['AAB', 'AAA', 64], ['ABB', 'ABB', 64].
 The team matchups are unique.
 The matches are sorted according to the lexicographical order of the teams.

Example 2
"""
# looking for a score of 63
score = 63
# running the function

['ABB', 'ABB', 58],
['AAB', 'ABB', 57]],
[['AAB', 'AAA', 64], ['ABB', 'ABB', 64]]]
In Example 2, a search for score=63 would return all the matches with a score of 64 for
searchedmatches; due to the fact that there is no score of 63 and 64 is the closest score which
is higher than 63.

If score=71 instead, then searchedmatches would be an empty list because there are no
matches that ended with a score of 71 or above.

['AAA', 'AAA', 62],
['AAB', 'AAA', 58],
['ABB', 'ABB', 58],
['AAB', 'ABB', 57]],
[['AAB', 'ABB', 30]]]
Lastly in Example 4 above, a search for score=0 would return matches with the score of 30 as
there is no score of 0 and 30 is the closest score which is higher than 0.
1.3 Complexity
The function analyze(results, roster, score) must run in a time complexity of O(NM)
and a space complexity of O(NM) worst case where:
 N is the number of matches within results.
 M is the number of characters within a team for each match.
 You can treat roster as a constant in your complexity analysis.
 You would need to account for the comparison cost for string. You can however treat
the comparison cost for integers as O(1).

 Make sure you account for the extreme and boundary cases during your complexity anal-
ysis, for example, the case where all matches within result have the same score.
